# Project Log

Running status for the JMDST reproduction, for teammates picking up work in
parallel. See `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for the full technical spec (Section A)
and detailed phase roadmap (Section B) — this file is just a quick "where
are we" snapshot, updated as phases complete.

## Status as of 2026-07-25

**Done and committed** (see `git log` for details):
- Phase 1: VisDrone2019-MOT + UAVDT converted to a unified JSONL format,
  with train/val/test splits matching the paper's counts (VisDrone 45/10/10,
  UAVDT 12/3/8) via a reproducible seed-42 split — see `configs/splits/`.
  Verified: 88 sequences, 42,474 frames, 929,343 annotations, 0 data issues.
- **Phase 2 done**: unified-to-YOLO exporter (`jmdst/data/yolo_export.py`),
  training script (`scripts/train_yolo.py`), and inference script
  (`scripts/infer_yolo.py`, applies the paper's NMS IoU 0.2 / conf 0.55 post-
  processing per Sec. 3.3). YOLOv11n trained 100 epochs on the full train
  set; checkpoint is at `outputs/yolo_runs/full_run/weights/best.pt` (not
  committed — gitignored, ~5MB, ask whoever ran it for a copy, or retrain
  with the command below). Validated: mAP50 0.45 / mAP50-95 0.27 overall;
  per-class mAP50 car 0.76, truck 0.40, bus 0.38, van 0.27 (van/bus are the
  weak spots — expected, they're a small fraction of instances vs. car).
  **Known issue**: validation mAP peaked at epoch ~2 and declined for the
  rest of the 100-epoch run (training loss kept dropping = overfitting).
  `best.pt` (not `last.pt`) correctly holds the early, better-generalizing
  weights, so this doesn't block using it, but a from-scratch retrain should
  use a low `--patience` (e.g. `--patience 10`) to stop automatically instead
  of burning the full epoch budget:
  `python scripts/train_yolo.py --data data/yolo/dataset.yaml --model yolo11n.pt --epochs 100 --patience 10 --name retrain_early_stop`
- **Phase 3 done**: FELNet architecture in `jmdst/models/felnet.py` (paper
  Table 1 exactly — Darknet-derived backbone + 3 conv heads for overlap /
  16-D embedding / confidence), plus `decode_boxes` (Eq. 2) and
  `select_anchor_output` (Sec. 2.2 selection rule). 20 unit tests pass;
  4.35M params, ~0.14 ms/SSI @ batch 32 on the 4070. Architecture only, no
  training yet.

**Not yet started**: FELNet training (Phase 4 — next up), feature extraction
(Phase 5), MSFP/Mamba (Phase 6, blocked on `mamba-ssm` installing), tracking
infrastructure (Phase 7), modified DeepSORT (Phase 8), full pipeline
integration (Phase 9), evaluation (Phase 10), ablations (Phase 11).

## What a teammate can work on right now, in parallel

Good parallel work is either CPU-only, or independent of whatever's
currently using the GPU:

1. **Tracking infrastructure (Phase 7)** — Kalman filter (predict/update for
   bounding boxes) and the tracklet state machine (tentative -> confirmed ->
   deleted, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` Section A.6). Pure algorithmic Python, no
   ML training or GPU involved, fully testable with synthetic trajectories
   without waiting on YOLO or FELNet.

2. **Evaluation metrics scaffolding (Phase 10)** — `motmetrics` is already
   installed. A script that takes predicted + ground-truth trajectories in a
   standard format and computes MOTA/MOTP/IDF1/HOTA (formulas in
   `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` A.9 / paper Sec 3.2) can be built and tested against
   synthetic/toy trajectories now, ready to point at real tracker output
   later.

Avoid starting Phase 4 (FELNet *training*) until Phase 3 (FELNet
architecture) is committed, since it depends on the model class existing.
Also avoid training anything large on the GPU at the same time as anyone
else, to avoid slowing both down / an out-of-memory error on the 8GB laptop
GPU.

## Setting up a fresh clone (if a teammate is on a different machine)

The raw datasets and all derived data (`data/unified/`, `data/yolo/`,
`Datasets/`, `outputs/`) are gitignored — only code is pushed. On a new
machine:

1. `conda env create -f environment.yml` (or see `requirements.txt`), then
   `conda activate jmdst`.
2. Get the raw VisDrone2019-MOT and UAVDT datasets locally under `Datasets/`
   (see `README.md` for expected folder layout).
3. Regenerate the unified format + splits:
   - `python scripts/make_splits.py ...` / `python scripts/make_visdrone_split.py ...`
     (see `configs/splits/` for the exact seed-42 split already decided on —
     reuse those `.txt` files rather than regenerating, so everyone trains
     on the same split).
   - `python scripts/prepare_dataset.py visdrone/uavdt ...` per
     `configs/splits/visdrone_conversion_plan.tsv` and the uavdt split files.
4. `python scripts/verify_converted_dataset.py --unified-root data/unified --skip-ssi`
   to confirm the data converted cleanly.
5. `python scripts/export_yolo_dataset.py --unified-root data/unified --output-root data/yolo`
6. Now `data/yolo/dataset.yaml` exists and `scripts/train_yolo.py` will work.
